# ExampleGSON
An example of how to use GSON in a Spigot Plugin with full serialization/deserialization. Also includes saving/reading from a JSON file.



How to test:
  Load it up on a 1.18 spigot server and u can use these commands:
  - /checkpoints add | Adds your current location as a checkpoint
  - /checkpoints remove | Removes any checkpoints at your current location
  - /checkpoints list | Lists all the checkpoints that are currently in use
  - /checkpoints save | Saves all of the checkpoints to file
  
  
> Feel free to use this however you please as I've made this as a way to learn how GSON works and how you can implement it into your plugins.
